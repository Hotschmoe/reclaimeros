# Reclaimer OS

Reclaimer OS is an innovative, containerized operating system designed for mobile platforms, with a focus on AI integration and modularity. Built primarily in Zig, this project aims to create a next-generation OS that leverages containerization for enhanced security, flexibility, and performance.

## Project Overview

Reclaimer OS combines cutting-edge technologies and concepts:

- **Zig Programming Language**: Primary development language, offering performance and safety.
- **Containerization**: Core architecture for modularity and security.
- **AI Integration**: Built-in Large Language Model (LLM) for advanced OS capabilities.
- **Hardware AI Acceleration**: Designed to leverage AI accelerators in modern mobile chipsets.
- **Android Compatibility**: Initial support for running Android apps in containers.

## Key Features

1. **Containerized Architecture**: Every major OS function runs in its own container.
2. **Integrated AI Assistant**: LLM-powered assistant for enhanced user interaction and system management.
3. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Efficient hardware management, including AI accelerators.
4. **Networking Stack**: Modular networking with support for cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.
5. **Android Compatibility Layer**: Run Android apps within the OS (planned feature).
6. **Security-Focused Design**: Leveraging containerization for enhanced system security.

## Architecture

Reclaimer OS is built on a layered, containerized architecture:

1. **Zig Kernel**: Core OS functionality.
2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Manages hardware-specific interactions.
3. **Container Runtime**: Manages and runs containerized components.
4. **Container Orchestrator**: Coordinates different containers.
5. **System Containers**:
   - LLM Container: Integrates AI capabilities.
   - Networking Container: Manages all networking functions.
   - Display Container: Handles graphics and UI.
   - Input Container: Manages user input devices.
   - Application Containers: Run user applications, including potential Android apps.

## Development Status

Reclaimer OS is currently in the early stages of development. We are focusing on:

1. Setting up the basic kernel and HAL functionality.
2. Implementing the container runtime and orchestrator.
3. Developing the AI integration framework.
4. Creating the networking stack.

## Getting Started

(Instructions for setting up the development environment, building the project, and running it in an emulator will be added as the project progresses.)

## LLM Context Prompt

For developers using LLMs to assist with this project, use the following prompt to provide context:

```
I am developing Reclaimer OS, a containerized operating system for mobile platforms. Here's a summary of the project:

- Primary language: Zig
- Architecture: Containerized, with each major OS function in its own container
- Key components:
  1. Zig Kernel
  2. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
  3. Container Runtime and Orchestrator
  4. LLM-based AI Assistant (as a container?) integrated into the OS
  5. Networking stack in a privileged container
  6. Planned Android app compatibility container
- Target hardware: Devices with AI accelerators (e.g., smartphone-like SoCs)
- Development stages:
  1. Basic kernel and HAL implementation
  2. Container runtime development
  3. AI assistant integration
  4. Networking stack implementation
  5. User interface development
  6. Android compatibility layer (future)

The project aims to create a modular, secure, and AI-enhanced OS leveraging containerization and edge AI capabilities. When providing advice or code suggestions, please consider this architecture and the use of Zig as the primary language.
```

This prompt can be used when seeking assistance from AI language models during the development process.
